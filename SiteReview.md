State of the Current Site
+	accessibility audit
  (https://wave.webaim.org/)  results:
  - most images were missing alt text
  -	link text color is low contrast (difficult for color-/visually-impaired to view)
+	mobile friendliness
  Google’s mobile-friendliness site:  not mobile-friendly
  -	Clickable elements too close together
  -	Viewport not set
  -	Text too small to read
  -	Content wider than screen
+	Performance
  (www.webpagetest.org):
 
**Summary**: a lot of bandwidth dedicated to images and scripts 

**Summary**: … and a lot of time spent loading, accessing, and rendering … 

**Google PageSpeed Tools**
*	*Optimization*: 65/100 (medium)
*	*Page stats*: PSI estimates this page requires 3 additional round trips to load render blocking resources and 1.1 MB to fully render.     The median page requires 4 render blocking round trips and 1.5 MB. Fewer round trips and bytes results in faster pages.
*	*Optimizations present*
  +	No landing page redirects
  +	Compression enabled
  +	HTML minified
  +	Above the fold content prioritized
*	*Optimization recommendations*
  +	Optimize images
  +	Browser caching
  +	Eliminate render blocking Javascript and CSS in above the fold content
  +	Reduce server response time
  +	Minify CSS
  +	Minify Javascript
*	*Functionality*
  -	The download brochure (pdf) link is broken (404 page not fount)
  -	Top navigation links all work
  -	Side navigation links all work
  -	Social network image links work
  -	University image links at bottom of page all work
  -	Main video works
  -	Helpful link ‘heating fuel comparison calculator’ Is broken (doesn’t point to a calculator)
  -	Energy industry page: images are click-able but serve no purpose (not linked to anything…don’t enlarge)
  -	The ‘visit us’ map/directions page works
  -	A lot of information on this site is out dated …is this site even being maintained? There doesn’t seem to be anything past 2015 in a     lot of cases (deadlines for applications that passed 3 years ago… no more current links to research/publications after 2015)
  -	Research page is reasonably well-organized by program and provides information about participants and published research
    Research info is out dated… in a lot of case there are no links to research past 2015
  -	Education page is also reasonably well-organized by topic
    Free online classes page is poorly laid out
    Out dated/poorly maintained
    Energy job info is old
  -	Demonstrations
    There is an error in the layout for this selection; unlike other choices, the box extends past the right border

*	*Ease of use*
  The site is clunky, unresponsive, slow, and difficult to navigate; a site you’d more than likely see back in 2000 than 2018. If it is   still an active site, it is poorly maintained; a lot of information is out of date and needs to be removed and/or corrected

*	*User Research*
  -	Not for casual browsers (targeted information for people who have a good sense of what they’re looking for)
  -	Educational Institutions (universities, similar programs, K through 12, libraries)
  -	Community advisory boards (town and city government agencies)
  -	Environmental advocacy groups

*	*Device support necessary*
  This site is not designed for mobile browsing. Something that would be intended for older computers/browsers (like those in libraries   and public schools).

*	*Recommendations*
  -	Review end-user consumption of material and more efficiently organize information – consider compartmentalizing the site for 
    targeted users: universities, media, local governments etc. 
    Greatly reduce number of navigational links and overall clutter
    Maybe a curated experience for each of the different type of potential user
  -	Review all content and make sure it is timely and correct
  -	Implement site optimization suggestions to speed up page-load times and delivery content more effectively
  -	Consider using the JPL site as a reference (good contemporary web site with community outreach and effective presentation)
  -	Modernize/beautify site: apply web design best practices (responsiveness, accessibility, efficiency, etc.)
